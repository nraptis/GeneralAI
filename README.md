# Generalized AI
</br>
Anyone is allowed to contribute to this. I will review any pull request until April 17, 2028, at which time I will re-evaluate this policy.</br></br>

The idea is this:</br></br>

1.) A generalized AI is created through a darwinian algorithm.</br></br>
2.) A generalized AI constantly improves itself.</br></br>
3.) A generalized AI is initially seeded by a human-directed fitness function.</br></br>
4.) A generalized AI will eventually be evolved from a "population" of AI's (we call them "Brain").</br></br>
5.) A generalized AI can be built from simple constituent parts.</br></br>
