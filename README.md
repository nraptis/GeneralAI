# Generalized AI

</br>
The first simple brain model to build. This diagram has gone through several rounds of consideration. To evolve, through the genetic algorithm, even a simple number adder, an entirely random process will take trillions of iterations. So my first plan is to evolve a brain which can solve "1+1" as "2" using a narrow language, such as a 4 byte language. By pruning "bad paths" early, it may be a problem which is solve-able in realistic time. I still don't know.

This is the overview / meta goal...

Anyone is allowed to contribute to this. I will review any pull request until April 17, 2028, at which time I will re-evaluate this policy.</br></br>

The idea is this:</br>
1.) A generalized AI is created through a Darwinian algorithm.</br>
2.) A generalized AI constantly improves itself.</br>
3.) A generalized AI is initially measured by a human-directed fitness function.</br>
4.) A generalized AI is best evolved with heuristics and non-optimal acceptance criteria (to speed it up)...
5.) A generalized AI can be built from simple constituent parts.</br></br>



It is intentional that I keep the brain as alien as possible;</br>
Similar to the animal brain, it has neurons and axons;</br>
However, the brain is ALL MACHINE... and ALL ALIEN... Meaning that it doesn't</br>
"Think like a human" at all... For example, it operates only on bits and rules...</br>
There is no concept of a byte... There is no concept of arithmetic...</br>
Through the genetic algorithm, the brain will LEARN the concepts of bytes and arithmetic...</br>
Similar to natural selection, we will only verify the quality of the brain's output...</br>
For the brain to exceed human intelligence, it cannot play by human rules... It must EVOLVE...!!!</br></br></br>
The way I invision this actually working is to eventually evolve up "brain pieces", and possibly have the brain able</br>
to brew "brain pieces" by itself. Then, through the random wiring, wire together these larger pieces. The</br>
larger pieces would still be "Neuron" but there would be many sub-Neurons and sub-Axons...
</br></br>
The shell of the program is remarkably simple. The shell is open to change. All these files are welcomed to be modified via pull request. This doesn't pay, it's just for fun.</br></br>
